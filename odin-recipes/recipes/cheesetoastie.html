<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon salted butter</li>
    <li>4 slices good-quality bread</li>
    <li>2 ounces cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p>There are some British foods that ooze comfort at the mere mention of their name, and none 
    more so than the cheese toastie. Alongside a bacon butty (bacon sandwich), the toastie is 
    the one that makes everyone drool. Cheese toasties are basically the same thing as 
    American grilled cheese and just as delicious.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Butter one side of each slice of bread. We don't recommend buttering both sides of 
            the bread for a cheese toastie since it can make the sandwich a bit soggy.</li>
        <li>Grate the cheddar cheese using a large hole grater (if you use a small hole the cheese 
            will melt too quickly before the bread has toasted). Divide the cheese between 2 slices 
            of bread, placing it on the unbuttered side.</li>
        <li>Season with a bit of salt and pepper to taste. Cover with the second slice of bread, 
            buttered-side up. </li>
        <li>Heat your griddle or frying pan to hot but not smoking. Using a flat spatula, lay 
            the 2 sandwiches into the hot pan (they should sizzle a little as they hit the panâ€”if not, 
            the pan is not hot enough). Gently press the sandwich with the spatula and do not worry 
            if the cheese leaks a little. Cook for a few minutes on one side pressing from time to 
            time, then flip it over and repeat on the other side. </li>
        <li>Remove from the pan once the cheese is starting to melt and the bread has turned a golden brown. </li>
