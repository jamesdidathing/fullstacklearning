<h1>Lasagna Recipe</h1>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
    <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
    <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p>For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and 
    layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the 
    run-down:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of 
            tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives 
            the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles</strong> and get the cheeses ready. We're using 
            ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese 
            blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
        <li><strong>From there, it's just an assembly job</strong>. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more
             sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have 
             used up all the ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong></li>
    </ol>
